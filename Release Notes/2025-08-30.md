# Release Notes

## v1.8.1 - 2025-08-30

This is a stability release that fixes several bugs identified after the multi-language and code refactoring updates.

### Fixed

* Fixed a critical `SyntaxError` in `utils.js` caused by a typo, which prevented the extension from loading correctly.
* Resolved a chain of `ReferenceError` and `TypeError` issues in `popup.js` that occurred due to the syntax error and a data mismatch in the `countryCodes` array.
* Corrected the disclaimer link, which was downloading the file instead of opening it in a new tab, by using a dedicated HTML page.
* Fixed a `runtime.lastError` (`The message port closed...`) by ensuring the background script properly sends a response to the popup.
* Ensured the "Open with" selection in the popup is immediately used for sending messages, without requiring the user to save it as a default first.

## v1.8.0 - 2025-08-30

This release expands the internationalization support by adding a comprehensive list of countries to the dropdown menu.

### Changed

* **Expanded Country List:** The country code dropdown now includes a wide range of major countries where WhatsApp is popular, making the extension more useful for international users.
* Updated language files (`en/messages.json` and `pt_BR/messages.json`) with translations for all new countries.

# Release Notes

## v2.1.0 - 2025-09-03

This release focuses on improving the extension's internationalization for a better Chrome Web Store presence.

### Changed
* **Internationalized Store Listing**: The extension's name and description in `manifest.json` are now pulled from the locale files (`__MSG_extName__` and `__MSG_extDescription__`). This allows the store listing to display in the user's native language (English or Brazilian Portuguese).
* **Refined Descriptions**: Added more engaging and descriptive text for the extension in both `en` and `pt_BR` `messages.json` files to improve user understanding of the features.

This is a major release that introduces a complete visual overhaul and re-branding of the extension.

### Added
* **New Dark Mode UI**: The popup interface has been completely redesigned with a modern, dark theme inspired by the "Chat Bubble Plus" branding. It features improved fonts, a new color palette, and a more intuitive layout.

### Changed
* **New Icons**: Replaced the old "WL+" icons with a new set of "Chat Bubble Plus" icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128) to match the new branding.
* **UI Component Styling**: All buttons, inputs, and labels have been restyled to align with the new dark-mode aesthetic, using gradients and high-contrast colors for better visibility and user experience.
* **Layout Overhaul**: The `popup.html` structure was updated to better organize the extension's features, including a prominent title and grouped input fields.

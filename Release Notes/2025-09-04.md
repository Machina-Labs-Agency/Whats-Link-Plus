# Release Notes

## v2.4.0 - 2025-09-04

This is a major UI/UX release that finalizes the dynamic layout of the popup, providing a much cleaner and more intuitive user experience.

### Added
* **Dynamic UI Resizing:** The popup now starts in a compact, focused view for sending messages. Clicking the "Link & QR Code Generator" button smoothly expands the window to reveal the generator panel.
* **Scrollable Recent Numbers:** The "Recent Numbers" list is now contained within its own scrollable area, preventing the main UI from overflowing vertically, regardless of how many numbers are in the list.

### Changed
* **Finalized UI Dimensions:** The popup width and height for both the compact and expanded states have been fine-tuned for a better fit and appearance.
* **Button Text Toggle:** The button to toggle the QR generator now dynamically changes its text between "Generate..." and "Hide..." for clearer user feedback.

### Fixed
* **Eliminated All Scrollbars:** Resolved all horizontal and vertical scrollbar issues that appeared in previous development versions, ensuring a clean, contained interface at all times.
